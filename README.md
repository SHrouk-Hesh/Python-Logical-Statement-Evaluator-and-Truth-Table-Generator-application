# Python-Logical-Statement-Evaluator-and-Truth-Table-Generator-application
The Python Logical Statement Evaluator and Truth Table Generator is a versatile application designed to assist users in evaluating logical statements and generating corresponding truth tables. With support for up to five inputs (a, b, c, d, e), users can conveniently input logical propositions and logical connectives in Python format to examine their truth values for all possible combinations of inputs.

## Key Features:
1. **Truth Table Generation:** The app allows users to specify the number of inputs (up to five) and write a logical statement in Python. It then efficiently generates a truth table that displays the truth values (TRUE or FALSE) for each combination of input variables, enabling users to understand the behavior of the logical statement comprehensively.

2. **Logical Connectives:** Users can insert logical connectives (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, exclusive or) to construct complex logical statements. The app intelligently processes these connectives and provides accurate evaluations for various combinations.

3. **Logical Equivalence Check:** Apart from generating truth tables, the application empowers users to determine whether two logical propositions are logically equivalent or not. This feature aids in identifying relationships and patterns between different logical statements.

4. **System Specifications and Queries:** The app also includes functionalities for system specifications and queries of combinations of universal and existential quantifiers, broadening its utility for more advanced logical operations.
